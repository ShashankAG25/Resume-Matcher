Resume Matcher using CountVectorizer

 
CountVectorizer is used to transform a given text into a vector on the basis of the frequency (count) of each word that occurs in the entire text.
CountVectorizer creates a matrix in which each unique word is represented by a column of the matrix, and each text sample from the document is a row in the matrix. The value of each cell is nothing but the count of the word in that particular text sample. CountVectorizer.fit_transform is used to get the cosine similarity between resume infromatiions and job description intormations,



Running Resume Matcher:

required libraries: (python3)

PyPDF2
pdfplumber
Scikit-learn 
time
os
csv 

install the required libraries or use the Virtual environment from the project 

update the paths in main.py
run main.py

PROPOSED METHOD:

3. traverse resume dataset and extract the texts from resumes
4. process the extractext text form resumes, Revome the new lines and other unwanted informations.
5 compare the processed resume texts to processed job descriptions using CountVectorizer.fit_transform()
6 store the resume details and cosine similarity value returned from CountVectorizer.fit_transform() in a result dictionay

repeat the steps 3 to 6 till all the resumes in the dataset is compared to job description 
To get top five matching resumes sort the result list in descending order and display first five resumes and its matching score
